Ansible for network devices


1. cannot use plain SSH, generally "ansible_connection=network_cli" is in use
2. recommended use of vault (at least), but most interesting is use of SSH keys for authentication (required additional configuration on network device side)
    "ansible-vault create <name>"
    ansible_user: user
    ansible_password: password
3. have to specify "ansible_network_os" in inventory
4. in playbook, provider is not required (and not possible for network device) as inventory is specified in the body of ansible-playbook command
5. have to specify vault name in playbook
6. before 1st launch, have to add SSH-key to known hosts on the Ansible server, easiest way:
    # ssh-keyscan <IP-addresses through spacebar> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts


for steps 1 and 3 it's possible to use group_variables
